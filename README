curses-apt-key is a (still very hackish) text-mode interface to
Debian's APT key management tool apt-key.

It is from scratch written in Perl and basically a text-mode clone of
Joey Schulze's Perl/GTK based gui-apt-key. It also reuses some of
gui-apt-key's internal Perl modules.

curses-apt-key depends on:

* libcurses-ui-perl
* gui-apt-key (needs its GAK::Backend)
* libcommon-sense-perl

The newest code is available at
https://github.com/xtaran/curses-apt-key for now.
